# B0-review-2022
Code to accompany "Off-resonance artifact correction for magnetic resonance imaging: a review" by Melissa W. Haskell, Jon-Fredrik Nielsen, and Douglas C. Noll. A preprint of this work can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01028. 

This code requires using the MATLAB version of the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT): https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt

Two of the main scripts, **run_fig5.m** and **run_fig6.m** reproduce Figs. 5 & 6 from the paper. The third main script, **mbir.m**, shows an example of model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) using a B<sub>0</sub> off-resonance fieldmap within the forward model (Equation 23 in the paper).
