# B0-review-2022
Code to accompany "Off-resonance artifact correction for magnetic resonance imaging: a review" by Melissa W. Haskell, Jon-Fredrik Nielsen, and Douglas C. Noll. A preprint of this work can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01028. 

This code requires using the MATLAB version of the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT): https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt

Note May 3, 2022: This version of the repo has the code needed for Figures 5 and 6 of the preprint. Additional model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) code using MIRT will be added in the coming weeks.
